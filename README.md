# NonIntNLP
Non-interactive NLP - Exploring state of the art NLP.

This repo contains experimental code for testing SOTA NLP models made available by huggingface through their [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
repo. It'll focus on providing well-documented examples.

This repo will be an experimental repo. I will spin off stable, reusable code into their own repo where necessary. If you
depend on this repo, make sure you depend on exactly the commit you need. I make no gaurantees of forward compatibility.
