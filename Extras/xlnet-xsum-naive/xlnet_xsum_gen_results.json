Overnight, the Conservatives claimed that Labour had a \u00a345bn \"black hole\" in its spending plans. Its \"dossier\" says the party has added up the spending commitments made by Labour since 2015, from scrapping the benefits cap to supporting the introduction of 10,000 new police officers. The Tories say the total cost of these policy commitments is \u00a364.8bn by 2020. Now, some of those spending pledges are offset by increased taxes, the Conservatives say. Labour has said it will raise corporation taxes and reverse planned cuts to capital gains tax. The Tories claim that will raise \u00a314.1bn over the same time period - leaving the \"black hole\" figure, the gap between their analysis of increased spending and increased revenues under a future Labour government. Labour has dismissed the document as \"misinformation and misrepresentation\", saying the Tories have costed policies that Labour is not committed to and failed to give their own commitments on tax and spending. So how do voters make sense of the row - the first, I am sure, of many on the economy during this election campaign. After all, despite the focus on Brexit, voters still put the economy and worries about issues such as rising prices towards the top of their political concerns. It is still the economy, stupid, when it comes to winning general election campaigns. First, it is correct to say that Labour has committed to some spending increases such as restoring the education maintenance allowance, restoring student grants and adding to the number of police officers. It says all of these are fully funded by increasing corporation tax and reversing the cuts to capital gains tax. So, voters can judge, voting Labour will lead to an increase in some taxes to pay for new policies. Other possible spending commitments contained in the Tory dossier - such as on arts funding - are more difficult to nail down and are just that - possible. Let's take one - that Jeremy Corbyn wants to increase the proportion of gross domestic product the government spends on the arts to match the European average. The Tory document also says that \"Labour will reverse Tory real terms cuts to arts expenditure\". Mr Corbyn did say that he would reverse arts spending cuts made since 2010, at an event in Edinburgh in August 2016. But Labour's general election campaign chief, Andrew Gwynne, has pointed out that this is not official party policy. For that, voters will need to wait for Labour's manifesto, which is expected to be published in the week starting 15 May. Some talk by Opposition politicians about what they might like to do is just that - talk. It can be criticised - maybe - for being \"loose-lipped\", but it does not make it an official spending commitment. What today has revealed is that there is a fundamental dividing line between the two parties. Labour will raise some taxes and fund some new policies. The Conservative offer is different. They will seek to balance the amount the government spends with the amount it earns in taxes, reducing the deficit to zero. They say by this method - and by keeping businesses taxes lower - the economy will strengthen, government revenues will increase and support for public services will improve. Don't deliberately borrow more now is the message. There is another big elephant in the room. Most of the Tories' \"black hole\" claim is made up of the \u00a335bn it says the Labour Party is committed to spending on improving Britain's infrastructure, such as providing better high-speed broadband. Labour has certainly spoken about investing \u00a3500bn over 10 years \"in infrastructure, manufacturing and new industries\". According to an interview given by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, in September 2016, \u00a3350bn of that will come from central government - so the Tory \"\u00a335bn a year\" figure of new spending on infrastructure (\u00a3350bn phased over 10 years) does not appear to be disputed. Although, again, we will have to wait for Labour's manifesto to see if that \u00a3350bn pledge is repeated. It's the impact of the pledge that is in dispute. The Conservatives say that the infrastructure money will have to be borrowed, adding to the \u00a31.7trn debt pile the country is already carrying. Mr McDonnell says that capital spending for investment should not be viewed as adding to a \"black hole\" as it is not day-to-day spending. Under the present public accounting system, nearly all spending commitments - whether current (day-to-day) or capital (investment) - is added to the public sector net debt figure. So, increasing borrowing means the national debt rises and funding the costs of the debt also increases. Mr McDonnell argues that borrowing rates on the international markets are cheap (true historically, although the rates are ticking up) and that the economic return on new projects outweighs the cost. If the economy grows, government income increases and deficit levels fall, Labour argues. There is one simple point at the heart of this row. The Conservatives say they are the party of economic stability, and that by maintaining strong controls on the public finances, national wealth will grow. Labour says that borrowing to invest will also lead to economic growth. Numbers will be thrown around. The moment to take notice is when the manifestos are published - by all the parties. What commitments are made on policies, on spending and on taxes? And what effect might that have on the economy. Which is what, after all, many people will vote on.<sep>"

Movies released this week by the Swarm team show how the field strengthens and weakens over time. They also illustrate the speed at which those changes occur. \"I'm interested in using Swarm data to see what's happening down in the planet's molten outer core, where fluid motions are generating this field,\" said Chris Finlay from the Technical University of Denmark. \"For me, this is real Earth exploration, because we know so very little about what is going on in that place,\" he told BBC News. The planet's magnetic field is a complex, multi-component problem. As well as that dominant signal generated 3,000km beneath our feet in the swirling convection of liquid iron, there are other contributions pulling on the needle of every compass. These include the magnetism retained in rocks, and even a very subtle effect derived from the movement of salt water ocean currents. The Swarm satellites' task is to try to tease apart these various factors, to get a clearer picture of the field's most significant behaviours. The magnetic \"bubble\" that protects us from space radiation is known to be in a long-term weakening phase, perhaps heralding one of the periodic flips where north becomes south and south becomes north. This hasn't happened for 780,000 years. Whether we're actually heading for another reversal now, scientists will only be able to gauge by studying the type of data coming from Swarm. In the movies showcased here at the Living Planet Symposium in Prague, the satellites' information is critical to the end of the animated sequences, which cover the past 15 years. One of the videos tracks changes in intensity in the magnetic field. Red is strong; blue is weak (top of page). The very dark blue region over the South Atlantic is the famous anomaly where the field's weakness allows radiation belts around the Earth to bite down into the atmosphere. It's over this zone where orbiting spacecraft suffer most of their electronic upsets. The movie reveals the anomaly to be widening, with its centre moving westwards, over Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. \"Look also at the patch over North America which is decreasing in intensity; whereas over Asia, it's been getting stronger. We haven't really noticed this much before. We see it happening really quite quickly in the last few years,\" explained Dr Finlay. \"And it's that change in the topology which is also the reason the magnetic north pole is drifting away from the Americas as well. This is a decadal trend and Swarm is allowing us to track it in great detail.\" The second movie describes the rate of change in Earth's magnetic field. Regions where changes are slowing are depicted in blue, while red highlights those locations where the changes are speeding up. An eye-catching feature is the oscillation west of Africa. \"We can now make these maps down at the outer edge of the dynamo, on the core-mantle boundary, and there we see a lot more of the small-scale details of the field change,\" said Dr Finlay. \"We can use those changes at the core surface to map the flow within the core. And, for example, this positive-negative-positive oscillation - we're seeing changes in the liquid motion within the core. There's an oscillation in the flow in the east-west direction, which is going back and forth on a timescale of about three years.\" The European Space Agency's Swarm satellites were launched in 2013. The three identical spacecraft carry a variety of instruments but their key sensors are state-of-the-art magnetometers that measure the field's strength and the direction. Two of the satellites, known as Alpha and Charlie, fly in tandem at an altitude of about 450km, and will descend over time. The third platform, Bravo, is higher up, over 500km, and is drifting away from the other two in its orbital plane. This geometry enables Swarm to see the magnetic field in three dimensions, and to better gauge its variations in time and space.

He was arrested in central France after his wife bought four rifles. Vikernes, described by French officials as a neo-Nazi, had in the past received a copy of a manifesto from Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011. Breivik planted a bomb in central Oslo and went on a shooting spree on the nearby island of Utoeya in July 2011. He was imprisoned for the maximum 21-year term last year. An official at the Paris Prosecutor Office said Breivik sent a copy of a manifesto setting out his ideology to Vikernes, who is also a convicted murderer. The official said: \"There were several indications that made the services fear he could possibly carry out a violent act.\" Kristian Vikernes was arrested along with his French wife in Correze, a region in central France. Police sources said officers were searching their home for weapons and explosives. By Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris French police have very broad powers to detain suspects, and they have used them here. On their own admission, there is no evidence that Kristian Vikernes was formulating any kind of plan. But intelligence officials obviously believe that given his background and his known beliefs, Vikernes is potentially a very dangerous individual. So after his wife bought the guns, they decided to take him in. The dark world of black metal neo-Nazism is not one with many supporters in France. It is in Scandinavia where the crude mix of Norse mythology and racial obsession has more of a following. Still, some of Vikernes's internet warnings against immigration and the European Union might have struck a wider chord in France - had anyone been reading - and in a recent pronouncement he expressed wholehearted support for National Front leader Marine Le Pen. It was the kind of extremist endorsement which Ms Le Pen will certainly not have appreciated. Officials say Vikernes' wife had a legal firearms permit when she bought the four rifles. Vikernes, a black-metal musician and writer known as Varg, was convicted in 1994 of stabbing a man to death in Oslo and burning down several churches. He was released in 2009 and moved to France with his wife and three children. On his website, Vikernes discusses Breivik's manifesto, but also criticises him for killing innocent Norwegians. Breivik's 1,500-page manifesto outlined his planned crusade against Muslims, who he said \"were taking over Europe and could only be defeated through a violent civil war\". Kristian Vikernes founded the one-man music project called Burzum in the early 1990s, which soon became a fixture of Norway's black metal scene. The word \"burzum\" means \"darkness\" in the Black Speech, a fictional language crafted by JRR Tolkien. \"In 1991, 18-year-old guitarist Varg Vikernes founded one of Norwegian black metal's most important bands upon a simple, yet powerful, platform: to bring darkness into the world,\" the magazine Guitar World wrote in 2010 after interviewing him. But he soon became involved in violent crime. In 1992, he took part in the arson of at least three churches in Norway. The following year, he stabbed to death fellow Norwegian guitarist Oeystein \"Euronymous\" Aarseth, who played with him in the black metal band Mayhem. Vikernes was given Norway's maximum 21-year sentence and released from prison in 2009 after serving 16 years. Since then he has continued releasing music and writing. Through his writings he promotes what he calls \"Odalism\", an ideology based on the idea that White Europeans should re-adopt \"native European values\". It includes racism, anti-Semitism and elements of ethnic European paganism.<sep>"

Jon Brown, from the NSPCC's sexual abuse programme, told BBC Radio 4's Today that cases in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and elsewhere had helped prompt \"children, young people and adults to speak about abuse that is either happening to them or has happened to them\". BBC home editor Mark Easton said police forces had put significant effort into encouraging victims to come forward and this appeared to be paying off. It is probable sexual offences are actually falling despite cases coming to light in recent years, he added. Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) lead for child protection, said police now looked \"upon child abuse very differently\". \"Many, many, more\" people had found the confidence to report incidents, he said, but the latest figures could be still only be \"the tip of the iceberg\". And Peter Wanless, the NSPCC's chief executive, said the figures were \"a fraction of the true number of victims, because some endure an agonising wait of many years before telling anyone - and others never reveal what has happened to them\". According to the figures, compiled by a Freedom of Information request: In 2012/13, the same research showed 22,654 cases were recorded by 41 police forces. All 43 forces in England and Wales responded in the latest study. The NSPCC said the total had largely remained steady until this year's figures, and that the 38% rise was the biggest increase in six years of requesting the data. The number has now increased by almost 50% since 2008/09. In Scotland, government figures showed that in 2013-14 there were 3,742 sexual offences against children under 18 recorded, including rape, sexual assault and grooming - a 10-year high. The NSPCC said 1,485 sexual offences against people under 18 were reported to police in Northern Ireland in 2013/14, up 26% on the previous year. By Mark Easton, BBC home editor The fact that police are recording more suspected incidents of child sexual abuse should probably be regarded as a positive development. Police forces have put significant effort into encouraging victims of such crimes to come forward and this seems to be paying off. Prosecutors and chief constables are under instruction to take seriously allegations that are made and, where appropriate, revisit reports made in the past. Britain is only beginning to recognise the appalling scale of child abuse and the criminal justice system still only deals with a fraction of offences. It is possible - indeed the recent focus on child welfare and big falls in overall violent crime makes it probable in my view - that sexual offences against children are falling, despite all the horrific cases that have come to light in the last few years. However, while more victims coming forward is good news, it is vital that the resources and support are available to deal with the increased demands on police and other services. The NSPCC's Mr Brown said there was not enough support available for children who had been sexually abused. \"Their concerns need to be taken seriously and acted promptly upon. \"Through the court process they need to be supported and there are some real gaps there, and then there's a huge gap in the amount of help and therapy that's available for children who have been abused.\" Mr Brown said the charity estimated that there was a shortfall of 50,000 places across the UK for children who needed treatment, having been sexually abused. The figures are published as the NSPCC launches its third annual \"How Safe Are Our Children?\" report at the charity's annual conference in London. A government spokeswoman said children must be protected from \"systemic and appalling cases\" of abuse such as those seen in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and elsewhere. She said: \"We have given child sexual abuse the status of a national threat so that it is prioritised by every police force, will shortly launch a new child sexual abuse taskforce and centre of expertise to improve local responses and we have provided A\u00a37m funding to organisations that support victims. \"It is encouraging that police figures show more victims are having the confidence to come forward and report these often ignored and under-reported crimes.\" Home Secretary Theresa May has established an independent inquiry to probe allegations of historical child sex abuse and a Westminster paedophile ring. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Over the past 18 months there's been a raft of data indicating that more people are reporting sexual offences. What's different about these statistics is that there's a breakdown by age of victim, enabling us to see the extent of the problem as it affects children. It's a deeply worrying picture. It raises questions about the level of support available for victims, at a time when criminal justice, welfare and health budgets are under strain, as well as the need to find ways to deal effectively with the perpetrators. To do that we must attempt to understand what drives people to commit offences against children and babies, however unpalatable that may be, to prevent further crimes in the future. Last month it emerged that police were investigating more than 1,400 prominent men for historic child sex abuse, including politicians, celebrities and those linked to institutions. And also last month, the NPCC said it had seen an \"unprecedented increase\" in the number of reports of abuse following the Savile cases coming to light. Mr Bailey said of the latest figures: \"The service now looks upon child abuse very differently and victims can expect a professional response. \"As a result many, many, more victims have found the confidence to report abuse, knowing they will be treated with sensitivity and respect, that we will listen to them and that we will take their allegations seriously.\"<sep>"

There has been no Tour de France for women since 2009. A new event this year was set up this year for women: La Course by Le Tour de France. However, former Olympic champion Nicole Cooke says it is a \"scandal\" there is no Tour for women. In her retirement speech she made her feelings on sexism in cycling clear, saying: \"It is somewhat of a handicap trying to demonstrate just how good you are on a bike when you are not allowed to ride.\" While both men and women take part in the long distance 10km marathon open water race, only women can take part in the 800m freestyle compared with the men's 1,500m freestyle race. Additionally men's synchronised swimming is not given a place in the Olympics. Lacrosse was first played in the UK by women at St Leonards boarding school in St Andrews in 1896. However, unlike the men's game, no contact was allowed. This remains unchanged 124 years later. Some bowling leagues have male-only policies. Most recently the Shropshire Premier Bowling League hit headlines for its \"strict male-only policy\". The president, who is standing down, claimed men were better players than women. A BBC Sport study in October found that 30% of sports pay men more prize money than women. Out of 35 sports that pay prize money, 25 pay equally and 10 don't. Football was one of the sports with the biggest disparities, including the World Cup and the Premier League. The good news is that the last statistics showed that the average wage gap for women and men in full time work is 9.4%, which is the narrowest gap since the two wages began being compared in 1997. The bad news is that once part-time work is included, that difference increases to 19.1%, which means that women earn 84p for every pound a man earns. The top three types of profession where the gender pay gap was highest were so-called'skilled jobs' which includes electricians, florists and chefs. Workers who operated machinery came next. The gender pay gap was third highest among managers, senior officials and directors. Currently 23% of directors on FTSE 100 company boards are women, according to BoardWatch, which tracks the appointments of women directors. In the top 250 companies, it found only 17.7% have women directors. The government has a target of 25% female representation on boards of FTSE 100 companies by 2016. Clare Balding said it would be great if women broadcasters could turn up to work in their pyjamas to prove a point about females being judged on what they look like. She spoke out about the issue saying: \"Women being judged on appearance: it stultifies talent. \"If you did that to men we would be caught up in a maelstrom - hah, a male-strom - of nonsense.\" Meanwhile down under, an Australian broadcaster turned up to work in the same suit for a year and nobody noticed. Karl Stefanovic wore the outfit to make a point about the sexism he said his female colleagues faced. \"But women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them,\" he said. In a 2013, a report showed that 87% of women thought they were judged more on their appearance than their ability. The report Equality for Girls was based on a survey of more than 1,200 girls and young women aged seven to 21. Despite there still being some way to go to complete equality, women in the UK are making gains. As Emma Watson said at the Davos World Economic Forum last week: \"It is my belief that there is a greater understanding than ever that women need to be equal participants in our homes, in our societies, in our governments, and in our work places.\" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube<sep>"

Collectively, South Africa's attack was excellent, none more so than pace bowler Duanne Olivier, who picked up three wickets in the Manchester gloom. When Jonny Bairstow became the seventh wicket to fall, England were 289 ahead and in danger of letting South Africa back in. Moeen, though, counter-attacked, dishing out some particularly brutal treatment to the previously economical Keshav Maharaj. Targeting the leg side, left-hander Moeen hit the left-arm spinner for three sixes, sharing an eighth-wicket stand of 58 with Toby Roland-Jones, who contributed 11. When the rain arrived at 17:15 BST, Moeen had taken 38 runs from the previous 22 balls he faced. Media playback is not supported on this device South Africa began the day on 220-9 and lost their last wicket when Olivier top-edged to Bairstow. Trailing by such a large margin, they needed everything to go their way with the ball and, though the bowlers played their part, they were not always backed up in the field. Jennings was dropped by Dean Elgar at third slip and Dawid Malan put down by a diving Temba Bavuma, with Kagiso Rabada the unfortunate bowler on both occasions. A potential Ben Stokes edge off Morne Morkel did not result in an appeal, with the same batsman put down by Heino Kuhn at short mid-wicket off Olivier. Bairstow and Roland-Jones also survived tough chances to Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis respectively. None were particularly costly in terms of runs, but the same cannot be said about an edge from Moeen off Maharaj to Elgar at slip, which just about carried. Moeen was on only 15 at the time. This was perhaps a last chance for Jennings, who averages 15.87 in eight innings in this series. The Durham left-hander, the 11th different partner for Alastair Cook since 2012, had not scored when he was given a life by Elgar and battled for more than an hour before lunch. Soon after the break he slashed at Rabada to be held at first slip by Amla. If his place is the one that is most under-threat, then the other new batsmen in the England side still have work to do in order to establish themselves in Test cricket. Tom Westley, who made a half-century on debut in the third Test, made only nine before edging a drive off Morkel, already a familiar dismissal. Malan, who has managed just 35 runs in four innings, tamely inside-edged to short leg off Maharaj for six. Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan: \"Maybe for Jennings it is best that he steps out of the pressure cooker, goes back to Durham and work on things. \"I think he has got better, he played a few nice defensive shots and a nice shot to cover, but he's not doing it consistently. \"Early in his innings he doesn't get his weight back on the ball. \"Who replaces him? Hameed was poor for Lancashire today, Stoneman would be next in line I think.\" Former England spinner Graeme Swann: \"Calls for Ian Bell to return? I don't think he will. \"His big chance was the first few games of the season and to score runs then. \"You've got to look at why players aren't picked, because someone at the top doesn't rate them. Personally, I think he is one of the best players ever, but by the end he just wasn't scoring heavily enough. \"I just can't see it.\"<sep>"

Despite the very real problems of poverty, corruption and the sense you sometimes get in some quarters, that no-one is held to account, business types hail Africa as the \"final frontier\". After nearly 12 years reporting this region, for me it feels like a place where one grows up. I have met priests and politicians, warlords and entrepreneurs, gangsters and teachers. Ordinary mums and dads. Each of them has helped to shape my impressions and many have become firm friends. One of the first lessons I learnt in Kenya was survival. There is no safety net here when times get tough. In the early days on a visit to the slum known as Kibera, an elderly lady called me over as she stirred her supper in a thick black cast iron pot. \"Hey sister, where are you from?\" she asked. \"London,\" I replied. \"Yes, but where in London?\" I was rather puzzled as she pressed me further. \"I know London,\" she nodded, sagely. \"In fact, I know Paris and Berlin, too.\" It emerged that this friendly stranger had once been a glamorous stewardess for a international airline. She had drunk the best champagne and visited the fanciest European hotels but when times got hard in the 1980s and the airline folded, she lost her job. She was now selling samosas in the slum to survive. From that day onwards I learnt never to make any assumptions about Africa: a jet-setter one day, a slum dweller the next. It the drumbeat of so many who take the knocks, but reclaim their dignity and survive. Yet, in absolute terms, people are getting poorer in Africa because the population continues to grow. During my time on this continent I witnessed a colleague of mine - away from the BBC - lose two of his three young children. That is never OK. When I arrived in Africa more than a decade ago, Boko Haram in Nigeria did not exist, Somalia's al-Shabab insurgency group had yet to be formed - not to mention the so-called Islamic State - and Sudan was one vast, sprawling country emerging from more than two decades of civil war. I arrived to a continent of 53 states. I now leave behind 54. South Sudan's independence in 2011 marked the newest addition to the globe. The birth pains are still being felt. When I arrived, George W Bush was beginning his second term as US president, oil and gas had yet to be discovered in many parts of Africa and mobile phones were just beginning to open up a world of possibilities from e-commerce to telemedicine. Now, two US presidents later (give or take a week or two), China has become the second-biggest investor in Africa, with India hard on its heels. The brain-drain is beginning to slow down as African talent is being retained, especially in the technology sector. And there is more money flowing back into Africa from remittances, than the entire aid budget for the continent. With this growing economic confidence, powered by a rising middle class, has come a new political assertiveness. And, with growing insecurity, the West knows it needs Africa more than ever before. You see it in the UN Security Council. South Africa has held its ground on issues such as Libya during the fall of President Gaddafi. The African Union is pushing for permanent seats and a greater say in world affairs as the continent now contributes more troops to peacekeeping operations than anywhere else on earth. You see this assertiveness in matters of international justice. Countries like South Africa and Burundi have turned their backs on the International Criminal Court. And you see this push back on matters of wider society and the tussle between the old way of doing things and what some see as imported Western ideas. A rapidly-growing young urban class, more connected with the world through mobile phones, is making new demands, touching on everything from gender equality to gay rights. A young female couple I met in Kenya back in 2006 had been forced out of their business as florists because word had got out that they happened to be gay. In Uganda, activists like David Kato would be murdered a few years later, for the simple fact that he was gay. Yet slowly, very slowly, there has been a perceptible shift. Constitutions are being shaken up. But there is still a tangible sense of mistrust between many African nations. Principles of sovereignty and non-interference, just like in many other parts of the world, are jealously guarded. And the settling of old scores between neighbouring continues to be played out in places such as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and its newer neighbour South Sudan. In many places, the slow roll-out of infrastructure is blamed for underscoring this continued sense of separation and investors say corruption continues to frighten off potential investors. Yet 2016 saw the creation of the first continent-wide trading bloc. At the moment only 10% of the continent's trade is conducted between African nations. But the potential is huge - 620 million consumers. The political landscape is also being redrawn. Regrettably, I have been banned from working inside Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe's leadership persists. And, as I write, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo and The Gambia are resisting pressure to stand down. But transfers of power are happening more peacefully. We have seen it, for instance, in Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal, and maybe also in Angola, where President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has ruled supreme for the past 37 years but has indicated that he will not stand again for re-election. I never really understood that institutions mattered until I moved to South Africa but, oh, how they do. The country's history may set it apart from other African states but South Africa's constitutional court, its free press and parliament have all challenged the legitimacy of President Jacob Zuma. And no-one has been killed for speaking out. It is a template other nations are keen to follow and I predict that, for many, it will soon come.<sep>"

His positive influence looked set to complement a solid display by O'Neill's side, but they will be frustrated with the non-existent marking which allowed De Jong to glance in from 10 yards just three minutes after coming on. It was the visitors' only effort on target and their ordinary display perhaps underlined why they fell short of qualifying for the European Championships. Danny Blind's side have now conceded in eight straight games - their worst defensive run since 1962 - and the Republic could have taken further advantage of that defensive weakness.

It is well documented that Dundee's season has been hamstrung by Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings' summer departures and their replacements are yet to make an impression. Paul Hartley has been proactive in trying to replace his former star pair but Marcus Haber, Faissal El Bakhtaoui and Rory Loy don't appear to be capable of scoring the 15 to 20 goals that Stewart and Hemmings were. Hartley has been forced to change the way he wants his team to play. They are now more direct and a target man may be at the forefront of his thoughts this window. Martin Canning may be more concerned with the vultures circling New Douglas Park with clubs ready to test their determination to keep midfielder Ali Crawford at Accies. Like Dundee, they don't have that player who is going to get into double figures with goals, Alex D'Acol and Rakish Bingham have both been used as the main striker, but Crawford is their top scorer with a lot of his strikes coming from set-plays. Eamonn Brophy is a talent but isn't yet chipping in with enough goals. These teams are working within a similar budget and are looking for a similar player - one that will score the goals to keep them away from the relegation places - if indeed he is out there. This will be an interesting window at Tynecastle, Ian Cathro's first as manager there. The big question mark would have been over Callum Paterson, who was expected to leave for a seven-figure sum before he was ruled out for up to 10 months with injury. The dip in form since the managerial change will have alarmed many at Tynecastle and they desperately need someone to do the job Adam Rooney does so well for Aberdeen. Conor Sammon and Tony Watt have flopped, to the extent they could both be gone by the end of the month. Richie Foran's men have conceded more than anyone else in the division - surprising given the normally reliable Josh Meekings and Gary Warren are at the heart of their defence. Foran has to look for another defender to give those two some competition though they are surely still two of the best centre-backs in the league. Whilst scoring hasn't been their biggest problem this season, another striker who can make the impact Miles Storey made last season when he arrived on loan would be beneficial to a relegation battle. Could they be tempted to ask Aberdeen if Storey is available again given he has started just twice for the Dons? They also need more creativity from the midfield. Killie look adequately covered in the forward areas with Kris Boyd and Souleymane Coulibaly supported by Nathan Tyson and Flo Bojaj, albeit Boyd hasn't been at his prolific best this season and Tyson and Bojaj are yet to prove themselves at Rugby Park. Centrally they are also quite strong. Defensively, however, they need tighten up if they are to avoid the spectre of relegation and Lee Clark will likely line up a new centre-half having already tried that in the summer with Scott Boyd and Will Boyle brought in. Miles Addison's injury problems haven't helped. Killie could also be doing with a creative midfielder behind the strikers in the 'number 10' role. But tightening up his leaky defence is Clark's priority. Mark McGhee's team is absolutely fine the further up the pitch you go, they have coped with the loss of Marvin Johnson by using youngsters Chris Cadden and Ross MacLean on the wings recently and clubs like Hearts, Aberdeen or Rangers wouldn't say no to Louis Moult and Scott McDonald. If there is a weakness, it could be the pace - or lack of - in their defence. Steven Hammell and Stephen McManus are terrific players but that side of the Well defence could do with an injection of pace. There can not be a team in the league who has missed more opportunities this season than Partick Thistle, with Ade Azeez the most guilty of all. Kris Doolan is a regular goal-scorer, but they really need to stop being so profligate if they are to avoid the drop. They should have beaten both Rangers and Hearts in recent times and another striker will be considered by Alan Archibald. At the back they look decent and Adam Barton has been a great signing, complimenting Liam Lindsay well at the heart of their defence. However, the knee problem suffered by midfielder Stuart Bannigan has been an issue in central midfield. His return would be like a new a signing. It sounds ridiculous to say that new defenders are required by Mark Warburton given they've only conceded six goals at home and of the 15 they've let in on the road, five of those were scored by a rampant Celtic. However, the centre-back pairing of Rob Kiernan and Danny Wilson has seldom convinced and the signing of Phillipe Senderos has not worked. Clint Hill has been decent, but is he the long-term answer? No. They could also be doing with an out-and-out winger. Barrie McKay has flirted with good form this season but the rest are either central players or want to be a striker. For the last two or three seasons, the Staggies have used this window to strengthen their squad. This time around it could be quieter, however, as they are picking up good results regularly. Two months ago that may have been a different story, but Jim McIntyre's squad looks strong and in Liam Boyce they have the league's top scorer, so they will hope there are no bids for the Northern Irishman. If anything, a centre midfielder may be on his mind as they are fine in the wide areas. It could be that Roy Macgregor's purse-strings don't require as much loosening this window. Tommy Wright tends to only sign players who can make an immediate impression on the first team and it could be a quiet window for the Perth club. Joe Gormley's lack of impact before quitting the professional game means there is scope for Saints to bring in another forward and a proven goal-scorer is probably the one area they could be doing with sorting out. However, their squad is almost certainly strong enough to maintain their now regular berth in the Premiership with their settled back four proving, generally, to be stubborn opposition.

Ranieri, 65, guided the Foxes to the title despite them being rated 5,000-1 shots at the start of the campaign. His departure comes less than 24 hours after a 2-1 defeat at Spanish side Sevilla in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. The Foxes took the Premier League title by 10 points but have won just five top-flight games this season, and could become the first defending champions to be relegated since 1938. They have lost their past five league matches and are the only side in the top four English divisions without a league goal in 2017. News app users should select this link to vote \"His status as the most successful Leicester City manager of all time is without question,\" added the Foxes statement. \"However, domestic results in the current campaign have placed the club's Premier League status under threat.\" Earlier this month, Leicester gave their \"unwavering support\" to the Italian, who was appointed manager in July 2015 and signed a new four-year deal in August 2016. \"After all that Claudio Ranieri has done for Leicester City, to sack him now is inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad,\" said former Foxes striker Gary Lineker. Media playback is not supported on this device BBC sports editor Dan Roan said: \"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla. \"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences. \"A news conference with assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at the stadium at 13:00 GMT on Friday.\" Leicester City vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha: \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City. But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be. \"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City. His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve. \"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign. But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Leicester's next game in their fight for Premier League survival comes when they host Liverpool on Monday. Assistant manager Craig Shakespeare and first-team coach Mike Stowell will take charge of the squad until a new manager is appointed. Ranieri's compatriots Paolo Benetti and Andrea Azzalin, both key members of his coaching staff, have left the club. \"The board will now begin the recruitment process and will make no further comment until that process is completed,\" Leicester added. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Phil McNulty, BBC chief football writer: It is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title. But is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners? Leicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday. After 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season. The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous. Ian Stringer, BBC Radio Leicester: I can't believe it. I was in Seville on Wednesday, they got an away goal and the fans were really happy on the streets after Jamie Vardy scored. He's gone. How can Claudio be gone? The greatest achievement ever. They are not in the relegation zone, the stadium has been singing his name and it's been very loud. I think there will be a split. He is a hero, they could build a statue of him in the next month and no-one would bat an eyelid, the greatest manager ever at this club. But is he the man to get you out of a relegation fight? The chairman is a Thai businessman; a billionaire; a very successful man. He kept the faith with Nigel Pearson when he struggled but brand Leicester City is very different these days. A big decision, a big call, but still surprising. 14 February 2016: Leicester lose 2-1 at Arsenal, their final defeat of the 2015-16 season before a 12-game unbeaten run. 2 May 2016: The Foxes are crowned champions of England for the first time in their history as Tottenham draw at Chelsea. 16 July 2016: Midfielder N'Golo Kante leaves to sign a five-year deal with Chelsea. 13 August 2016: Leicester lose their first game of the 2016-17 season - a 2-1 defeat at Hull City. 15 October 2016: The Foxes are hammered 3-0 by table-topping Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. 22 November 2016: Leicester secure top spot in their Champions League group with one game to spare. 18 December 2016: Ranieri is named Coach of the Year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. 7 February 2017: After a run of two wins in 15 league games, Leicester give Ranieri their \"unwavering support\". 22 February 2017: The Foxes lose 2-1 to Sevilla in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. 23 February 2017: Ranieri is sacked.

It's quite incredible.\" Smyth was greeted by his wife Elise and 10-month daughter Evie, who burst into tears amid the cheering in the arrivals hall. \"She's not used to all that screaming so she started crying,\" laughed the county Londonderry man. \"But it's just great to be back. Three weeks is a long time to be away, especially when she is that small.\" Both Northern Irishmen intend to prolong their Paralympics careers until the next games in Tokyo and McKillop reckons the Japanese capital would be an appropriate place and time to end his racing days. \"I hope and pray that I will be in Tokyo. That's where I want to retire.\" His girlfriend Nicole wasn't able to travel to Rio but McKillop wants her to be with him, \"when she will be my wife\", when he rounds off his glittering Paralympic career in four years. Visually-impaired Smyth, whose Stargardt's condition means he has less than 10% vision, has never lost a race at Paralympic level in his 11-year career. \"If I could get through my entire Paralympics career unbeaten, that for me would be a pretty impressive achievement.\"<sep>"

But United's disjointed attack finally found some fluidity when expensive loan signing Radamel Falcao was replaced after an hour, and recalled midfielder Ander Herrera led the revival. Media playback is not supported on this device Herrera, making only his third start in three months, squeezed home the equaliser with Wayne Rooney avoiding contact with the ball in an offside position, before Marouane Fellaini's close-range finish gave United the lead in a thrilling tie. Rooney, back playing in a more advanced role, made certain of victory with a late penalty that he won and converted himself to give the scoreline a gloss that Preston did not deserve. If United boss Louis van Gaal did not quite restore Rooney to his front line for this tie, he did at least push his captain higher up the pitch from the deeper midfield position he has occupied recently. His movement was impressive early on but being closer to the sharp end did not allow Rooney more scoring opportunities, with a blocked shot from Luke Shaw's pull-back his only effort on goal in the first half. His United team-mates were also frustrated as they struggled to break down a well-drilled and hard-working North End side, roared on by a noisy home support. Angel Di Maria bent a free-kick a few inches wide but that was the closest the 11-times winners came to making the breakthrough before the interval. However you described Van Gaal's latest formation - 4-1-2-2-1 being a close approximation - it was not helping United turn their vastly superior possession into chances. When they did find time and space in dangerous positions their delivery was frequently disappointing, with Di Maria a repeat offender with wasted balls. Media playback is not supported on this device It all meant Preston goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann did not have a shot to save before the break North End's own threat had been restricted to a couple of tame shots from distance and a Joe Garner header that looped over the bar. But that all changed two minutes into the second half when Garner sent Laird galloping into the box to power in a shot that was heading wide before deflecting off Antonio Valencia and squeezing under De Gea. United's response was hardly venomous, with the Preston defence easily dealing with the crosses hoisted into their box. In fact the home side went closer to making it 2-0 when Tom Clarke got on the end of a whipped free-kick but could not connect with his shot in front of goal. After an hour, Van Gaal had seen enough. He hauled off the ineffective Falcao for Ashley Young in a change that helped turn the game in his side's favour. Media playback is not supported on this device Young supplied the pass for Herrera's equaliser and Fellaini, pushed further forward as part of the switch, followed up his own saved header to power home United's winner from close range. Preston were not quite finished yet, with Kyel Reid fizzing one shot wide and Callum Robinson firing another straight at De Gea from the edge of the area. But United made sure of their progress with two minutes to go when Stuckmann sent Rooney tumbling, although there were some suggestions he might have dived, and he stepped up to send his penalty high into his net. Preston boss Simon Grayson: \"We did create some good chances at times and the players can wake up in the morning and be very proud of what they've done. \"Hopefully we can use this as motivation for the rest of the year. Our sole aim at the start of the season really was to get promoted to the Championship. \"We'll take a lot of positives and we'll take the money - we need more money to get some more players in.\"<sep>"

And for City manager Pep Guardiola, this was much more than a result that redressed the balance in Champions League Group C. City's lengthy pursuit of Guardiola finally came to fruition when it was announced on 1 February that he would join the club after leaving Bayern Munich. It was the crucial move City's Abu Dhabi-based hierarchy had been working towards for years, with an infrastructure already based heavily on the one the Spaniard had at Barcelona, with his old friend and former colleague Txiki Begiristain as director of football, and Ferran Soriano as chief executive. City's house was effectively built in readiness for Guardiola's arrival, and his appointment was the day they had been planning for. Begiristain and Soriano, and all in power at the club, will have looked on approvingly as the team made the biggest statement of Guardiola's short time in charge, against the club where his - and their - philosophy was formed. This was the sort of thunderous celebration of football, and victory, they always had in mind through the years of courting Guardiola. This was why City's powerbrokers felt the wait for Guardiola was always going to be worthwhile. They may have reached the Champions League semi-final under the low-profile Manuel Pellegrini last season, but they went down to Real Madrid with a whimper. The sight of Barcelona being beaten in an eye-to-eye thriller will have raised both the pulse rate and expectations. This was not the sort of behind-the-door display that left City and their supporters frustrated against Real. Once Ilkay Gundogan equalised after a moment of carelessness from Sergi Roberto just before half-time, there was only going to be one winner. They were perhaps more direct than the football of Guardiola's perfect world but their pace, movement, passing and unwavering attacking intent carried all of his hallmarks. Guardiola recognised the significance of the win when he said: \"It is a good step to say that once in our lives we played against the best team in the world and we beat them. \"We competed with Barcelona, but for now we did it in a different way. We played more long balls because we are still not ready to keep the ball and play like they do. They have been playing that way for 25 years. For us, it is three or four months we have been trying to play in a different style.\" Guardiola's vision is clear. It is far too early to say one win, albeit against Barcelona, brings about the realisation of that vision - but this was a display that brought the future under his leadership into clearer view. Media playback is not supported on this device Guardiola had admitted he had doubts during City's recent six-match winless streak - but not about his methods. He said: \"The principles? No doubt. But to know the players, how they play with other ones, how you play in different systems, sometimes you make a doubt, yes.\" This was the night Guardiola's principles and players came together in a manner which should send a surge of confidence and self-belief through the manager, his squad and the club. It would have been easy for City to subside in the face of a searing spell of pressure from Barcelona either side of the half-hour, but once they were presented with that unexpected opportunity to equalise, they were ruthless. The otherwise excellent Raheem Sterling had already squandered a chance before Kevin de Bruyne's fine free-kick put them ahead after 51 minutes, and they had other opportunities before Gundogan wrapped things up 16 minutes from time. City refused to be cowed by Barcelona's superstars, and the simple fact they fought it out with arguably the finest team on the planet and emerged triumphant should provide them with a deep reservoir of confidence for the future. They pressed high, smothered Barcelona and beat them at large parts of their own game. The arch-perfectionist Guardiola will always want more but this was a night deserving of his satisfaction. Guardiola said: \"If you talk about the whole performance then, for the first 38 minutes, we were still not able to compete with the best clubs in the world, but in the second half it was different. \"I saw my players were upbeat - they knew they had gone through their bad moment. That sureness that Barca had in the first half, we were able to turn that around.\" And in a message that suggested this 90 minutes could eventually be seen as a defining moment for City, Guardiola added: \"Now they will realise they have beaten the best team. Future generations will see that and know they have to do that again. That is a process. \"It was the same with the group of players with Joe Hart and Vincent Kompany, who won Premier League title twice in five or six years together. The players arriving at the club now understand they have to do that, or try to do that, too. \"It is not as though our owner Sheikh Mansour and our chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak could come here and say 'we are going to create the best team in Europe.' You need 10, 15 or 20 years to stay there. \"We are going to try to reduce that time, to leave nights for City fans like they got against Barcelona.\" City have struggled to make their big statement in the Champions League. This was it. They finally beat Barcelona at the sixth time of asking, ending the Catalan club's run of seven successive wins against English sides in Europe. City's three goals amounted to more than they had scored in those five previous losses. It was also the first time an English side has scored three or more goals in a Champions League group game against Barcelona since Manchester United did so 1998-99. Guardiola's big players demonstrated they have the power to trouble any defence in Europe. Yes, Barca were without key defender Gerard Pique and midfield maestro Andres Iniesta, but nothing should diminish City's achievement. De Bruyne's goal and creativity illustrated his standing as one of Europe's finest attackers, while the elegance and stealth of Gundogan has added an extra dimension and extra menace to City. Sergio Aguero never stopped running, buying into Guardiola's demands, while Sterling once again showed how far he has come in such a short time under his new manager. City's fans lapped up every moment, revelling in seeing the masters outmanoeuvred by the star pupil from Barcelona's school. It felt like the moment this club has been waiting for. If City can beat Barcelona they need fear nobody - which is the message Guardiola is likely to be delivering. In many respects, this felt like the night Pep Guardiola really arrived at Manchester City. The club have waited for Champions League nights like this - and this was their best to date.<sep>"

But it was her dance instructor who unlocked her talent for smart, dark pop songs when he asked her to submit a song for class. Along with her older brother Finneas, Billie came up with Ocean Eyes - an astonishingly assured ballad which compared falling in love to falling off a cliff under \"napalm skies\". She posted it on Soundcloud so her teacher could hear it, went to bed, and woke up to a flurry of emails about her burgeoning music career. Since then, she's been on a steep upswing, signed by Interscope Records and releasing one head-turning track after another. The highlight (so far) is Bellyache, in which she sings from the point of view of a conflicted psychopath. \"Where's my mind?\" she trills as an acoustic guitar trades blows with a gut-punch drum loop. \"Maybe it's in the gutter, where I left my lover.\" It's the pop equivalent of a Tarantino movie - finding comic absurdity in the midst of eye-popping gore. The lyrics might keep it off the radio, but Billie isn't too worried. \"I don't need many people to care,\" says the singer. \"Even if other people don't like it, I like it.\" As she gears up to release her first EP, Eilish sat down for a frank chat with the BBC about her lyrical fantasies, getting to grips with the music industry and her very unusual middle name. Hello Billie Eilish... Have I pronounced that right? Yes! It's eye-lish, like eyelash with a lish. Your family name is O'Connell, though, so is that a stage name? It is my middle name. So I'm Bille Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell. Pirate! That's an amazing name. Pretty weird, right? Pirate was going to be my middle name but then my uncle had a problem with it because pirates are bad. Then Baird is my mother's name. Sigrid: Approaching pop from left-of-centre Dua Lipa on relationships and Chris Maetin Halsey on rising above depression Tove Styrke: 'Writing pop is like solving a puzzle' It's been a year since Ocean Eyes went onto Soundcloud. It was written for a dance class, right? Oh yeah! My dance teacher knew that I sing, so he asked us to make a song and I thought that was the coolest thing ever. My brother had written Ocean Eyes and we recorded it, basing all of the production around contemporary and lyrical dance. I think of most songs that way - if you can't dance to a song, it's not a song. Anyway, we put it on Soundcloud, literally to send the link to my teacher and then it just grew from there. It's been played more than nine million times now. When did you notice it was taking off? It was really confusing. I didn't understand what was going on. I literally thought it was like my popular friend had reposted it. 'Wow, it's getting so many listens!' What happened next? A lot of meetings! What are those meetings like? Do you go in super-confident, like, \"I've got the goods, what are you going to offer me?\" or is it totally nerve-wracking? I was 13 when this started, so I didn't know anything about anything. I'd go into meetings and they'd say, \"So Billie, what do you think?\" and I'd just be like, \"Am I supposed to know? Because I don't,\". But eventually I got the hang of it. And now the meetings I have are a bit more like, \"OK, Billie, what exactly do you want?' and then I explain every single detail of every single thing that I'm thinking; and people do it! It's insane. You have stuff floating around in your mind and you tell somebody and they go, \"Oh yeah, we can make that happen\". It's like, \"What? WHY?\". So it's like Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility. I am exactly like Spider-Man. I promise. I get the impression from your lyrics, especially, that you have a very clear idea of the things you want to talk about. How do you approach writing? Lyrics are so important but they're really underrated. So many lyrics right now are just the same thing - \"Oh, I love you but I'm sad because you don't love me and... blah\". You can say that in a more interesting way. Me and my brother write a lot of fiction. Like in Bellyache, obviously. I don't kill people. That's a relief. Right? But you can put yourself in a character or a situation you would not normally be in. You don't have to be in love to write a love song. You don't have to kill somebody to write a song about killing somebody. It's like jumping into another world. So do you consider it like acting? Or do you really want to murder someone, but haven't got round to it yet? Yikes! Maybe... But both of my parents are actors, and I was in plays when I was younger. Then I went to an audition and I came back going, \"I hate this. I'm not doing this ever again.\" What happened at that audition? Some lame stuff, dude. But it's just fun to get to tell a story [in a song]. If you just write about things you've been through, you might get to a point where you go, \"I don't feel like this any more, so it's not worth pursuing\". No. No. It's especially worth it. What's the lyric you're proudest of? Well, I wrote Bellyache with my brother, and he wrote Ocean Eyes, and we have a ton of other songs on the EP that I'm really excited about. Do you find you write better with him than anyone else? We've had sessions with artists and writers and producers and not that those sessions were bad, but when we write, just us together, it's so much more raw, I guess. And straight from the heart. Tell me how Bellyache came to be... I wasn't like, \"Let's write a song about killing someone!\". We were sitting in my garage rehearsing for a show with my brother's friends. Finneas started riffing on the guitar, and one of them started playing on the piano, and I sang the first line - \"Sitting all alone, with a mouthful of gum in the driveway\". Then my brother sang, \"My friends aren't far, in the back of the car\" and I was like \"Lay their bodies,\" like I had killed them. And he just said, \"Woah, that's so cool!\". It just grew from there. He came into my room a couple of days later and he was like, 'dude, I wrote the chorus for this'. And he sang it all, and the last line was, \"And now I got a bellyache\" and I was like, \"That is genius\". It's such a childish line. No grown up says, \"I have a bellyache, I gotta go\". But it's kind of part of the song, because it's about someone whose really young and knows they're a psychopath. They're like, \"Maybe I shouldn't steal this money and kill these people... but I'm going to anyway\". It's a very cinematic lyric. You can see the film opening on you in the car, then the camera cuts to the bodies in the boot. Some people don't really realise what I'm saying until they've listened to it a couple of times. My friends would be like, \"Dude I was listening to Bellyache the other day, actually listening to it, and what the hell were you writing about?\". And then you say, \"I'm glad you've heard it. Now never cross me again\". Exactly. Don't wrong me. Your new song is called Copycat. What's that about? You'll understand when you hear it, but it's about people who feel justified in copying everything you do. It's not about someone particular, I just wrote it. I had two sisters growing up - and that sort of thing seemed to happen quite frequently in their peer groups. Is it a girl thing? It probably is, and it's tortuous. Especially if it's somebody close to you. It's like, \"Be your own self - don't try to be me!\". You've just played your first headline show in the UK. Do you get nervous? Not really. I don't get nerves, I just get excited. Does your dance training help with confidence and stage presence? Yeah. I mean, I was really a dancer. Then I got injured, so I haven't really danced since Ocean Eyes came out. Oh no, what happened? I strained my growth plate. My bone separated from my muscle in my hip. It was really bad. It's so weird, because it can't happen to you if you're over 16 - but I was in a class with a bunch of seniors, because I was at that level. We were doing hip-hop and it just popped. So I haven't really danced since then, which was like a year-and-a-half ago, which has been horrible. There is a dance video for Ocean Eyes, though, so are you on the mend? I was injured for the dance video, actually. I had sprained my ankle in December,and I had also strained my groin and I have shoulder problems. That's a sign to concentrate on the music. I guess it is, but I'm trying to get back into dance slowly. I love movement. I love moshing. I always heads right for the front and dig in there and mosh really hard with all the guys.

But a very different candidate is slowly gaining on him. On Tuesday, news broke that Dr Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon popular with evangelical voters, has just about tied Trump according to a new New York Times/CBS News poll. Carson strikes a dramatically different political pose, often noted for his calm demeanour and professorial speech style. Carson's support leaped from 6% to 23% among likely Republican primary voters, whereas Trump increased his margin only slightly from 24% up to 27%. However, both men have made much of their status as political outsiders. \"I'm not politically correct,\" Carson has said many times. \"I am not a politician.\" So who is he? Early life Ben Carson was born in 1951 in Detroit, Michigan. His mother raised him and his siblings after their father left the family when Carson was 8. He credits his mother, Sonya, with prioritizing his education even after he struggled with his grades. Carson eventually went to Yale, where he met his wife Candy. Then he studied at The University of Michigan School of Medicine. He did his residency at Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore, Maryland, where he became the director of paediatric neurosurgery at just 33 years old. He pioneered techniques for operating on brain cancer and epilepsy. Carson gained international fame in 1987 for performing the first successful surgery on twins conjoined at the head. The pace of his work slowed when he was diagnosed and then successfully treated for prostate cancer in 2002. Best-selling author and television fame He has written a number of books including a 1990 memoir called Gifted Hands. In 2009, it became the basis for a movie on the television network TNT in which Carson was played by Cuba Gooding Jr. He also spent much of his time speaking to classrooms of young students in Baltimore. \"I can't even count how many times I saw Ben Carson when I was a kid,\" writer Ta-Nehisi Coates once told to GQ magazine, \"Any time anyone wanted to bring out any sort of inspirational figure for young black kids, especially young black boys, in Baltimore, you turned to Ben Carson.\" The books also lay out Carson's strong religious convictions. He was raised a Seventh Day Adventist and these religious beliefs also inform many of his political views. Political aspirations Carson began drifting toward politics with the publication of his 2012 book, America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great, which was critical of the election of Barack Obama. He then rose to fame in the conservative political arena after giving a speech at a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast that was unexpectedly critical of Obama's health care plan. The president was sitting just two chairs away, and Carson was exuberantly lauded for his gall by Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin. In a subsequent speech, he called Obamacare the \"worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\". Later that same year, he retired as a surgeon. A political action committee named \"Draft Carson\" began quietly amassing a $14m war chest, and in May 2015, Carson announced he would enter the presidential contest as a Republican. He has credited the draft movement as a major reason he jumped into politics. Conservative and controversial views Though his affect may differ from Trump's, Carson also has a history of controversial statements which have landed him in hot water. While he concedes that gay marriage is now \"the law of the land,\" at one point he told an interviewer that marriage should be between a man and a woman, and that \"no group, be they gays, be they Nambla, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are, they don't get to change the definition\". He also once said that homosexuality is a choice and said prison inmates were evidence of this. He subsequently apologised forboth comments.

After investigating the demise of the project, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has branded the programme \"a complete failure\". Chairman Margaret Hodge said the BBC needed to \"overhaul\" its approach to such projects, to \"safeguard licence fee payers' money\". The BBC originally approved DMI in 2006. It was supposed to produce new editing tools, an online archive of the BBC's programmes and a new database. Technology company Siemens was hired to develop the project in February 2008, and it was expected to be completed the following year. However, after a series of delays, the project was brought in-house, There it floundered until last May, when the BBC's incoming director general, Tony Hall, admitted it had \"wasted a huge amount of licence fee payers' money\". The gross estimate of the amount spent on DMI was \u00a3125.9m, although the BBC claims to have recouped \u00a327.5m of that. The BBC's technology chief, John Linwood, was sacked in July 2013 over the project's demise. A previous report, by the National Audit Office (NAO), blamed \"confusion and a lack of planning\" for the failure. It said that senior executives failed to take control of the project when it ran into trouble and \"did not appear to appreciate the extent of the problems until a late stage\". The PAC published its own findings on Thursday. It reiterated several of the points raised in earlier reports and criticised the BBC for its failure to alert MPs of the problems. \"When my committee examined the DMI's progress in February 2011, the BBC told us that the DMI was... absolutely essential... and that a lot of the BBC's future was tied up in the successful delivery of the DMI,\" said Ms Hodge. \"The BBC also told us that it was using the DMI to make many programmes and was on track to complete the system in 2011 with no further delays. \"This turned out not to be the case. In reality the BBC only ever used the DMI to make one programme, called Bang Goes the Theory. \"The BBC was far too complacent about the high risks involved in taking it in-house. No single individual had overall responsibility or accountability for delivering the DMI and achieving the benefits, or took ownership of problems when they arose.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"Tony Hall was right to scrap the DMI project when he took over as director general last year. As we said at the time, the BBC didn't get DMI right and we apologised to licence fee payers. \"Since then we have completely overhauled how these projects are delivered so that there is crystal clear accountability and transparency.\" A spokeswoman for the BBC Trust, the corporation's governing body, said: \"As we have said before, this represented an unacceptable loss to licence fee payers. \"Acting on the conclusions of previous reports into DMI, we have strengthened reporting to the Trust so that problems are spotted early and dealt with quickly. \"We are also carrying out follow up reviews once projects are completed to make sure the lessons from DMI are being implemented.\"<sep>"

The final decision on whether state aid is allowed is down to the European Commission. It applies rules agreed by every country in the EU. But the steel industry is a special case. Because the European Union already produces more steel than it needs, the member states of the EU agreed to allow uneconomical producers to go bust, rather than let governments save them. So that is the first question for Port Talbot and the other parts of Tata Steel UK - can they survive on their own? If they can't then the government's hands are tied. There are some ways round the rules. The first is national security. Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome, one of the founding treaties of the EU, countries can \"take any measures necessary\" if an industry is essential to national security. This is supposed to refer to arms, munitions and \"war material\". Does it apply to hot rolled steel? Legal experts think it's unlikely, although Lord West, the former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff has told the BBC that UK production is vital for the defence sector. The second is a move to avoid \"a serious disturbance to the economy\". This was one of the arguments used to justify the bank bailouts. It might also be used to justify aid to the Greek banking system. But the loss of 15,000 UK jobs - or even 40,000 UK and European jobs - may simply not be considered a serious enough disturbance by the European Commission to justify a government handout. The last option isn't state aid at all. A government can own a company under state aid rules but it is not allowed to keep it going if it would otherwise fail. This is the closest the government can come to \"nationalisation\". If the government can convince the European Commission that buying a business is a sensible move that any investor would make for a profit then it is not classified as state aid. However with Port Talbot reportedly losing \u00a31 million a day this may be a tough sell. State aid is not banned in the European Union, but it is tightly controlled, and in 2008 the banks met the necessary criteria for a bailout. As well as being vital for the stability of the economy, it was generally accepted that the UK banking sector had a profitable future. The aim of the EU state aid rules is to ensure any government intervention produces a sustainable independent industry. As far as the rules are concerned, it is hard to make that argument for the UK steel industry. However, in the coming weeks many people will be doing just that, and adding that it is the government's role to provide a bridge - of some sort - to a sustainable future for UK steel.<sep>"
